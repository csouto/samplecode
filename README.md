# Sample Code 

Hi!
Just created this repository to show some code I’ve written (still building it!). The first [folder](https://github.com/csouto/samplecode/tree/master/CS50x) contains solutions for the CS50x problem sets in C, Python and javascript.

### Some projects:

-> This [project](https://github.com/csouto/samplecode/tree/master/CS50x/pset6/sentiments) uses Flask, Python and Twitter API to do some sentiment analysis. It retrieves tweets from a given user, check if each message is positive or negative and generates a chart with results.

-> This [web application](https://github.com/csouto/samplecode/tree/master/CS50x/pset7/finance) allows users to quote stock prices, “buy” and “sell” shares storing info on a database. (Buy and sell are only fictional because the application is not configured to use trading APIs.)

-> This [web app](https://github.com/csouto/samplecode/tree/master/CS50x/pset8) uses Google Maps and Google News to show a map where users can search for articles for a given location.

-> A [spell checker](https://github.com/csouto/samplecode/tree/master/CS50x/pset5/speller) written in C that uses a hash table to store dictionaries.

-> A [command line application](https://github.com/csouto/samplecode/tree/master/CS50x/pset4/recover) written in C that recover some images (jpg) from a raw memory card image.
